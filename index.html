        <div class="subheading mb-5">B.S Biology Majorüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm currently graduating in spring 2022 and have plans to be in a research opportunity.  I recently passed my EMT course at West Coast EMT and have accomplished all the skills necessary for keeping a patient stable. The reason for my passion in the medical field is because I have had a history with health issues in my family. Being at a young age and going to the hospital with my grandmother has allowed me to experience all the types of jobs that are offered at a hospital. Also, I have experienced a near death experience and being in a hospital setting has allowed me to further love the medical field. 
Before getting operated on my appendix, I had never struggled with any major health problems. For the most part, I maintained a pretty healthy lifestyle at the age of fourteen and never experienced the unfortunate trip to the emergency room. Nonetheless, it never came across to me that my life could be taken at any moment, and as a result, I never felt as grateful for living as I should have been.It was not until February 2014 that I truly was in a situation where I was faced with near death. I remember so vividly awakening on a Wednesday morning with a substantial amount of torment that felt like knives were hardheartedly cutting up my inner organs. The amount of time it took me to get up from bed felt like an eternity as I could not propel myself from my mattress, but once I managed, my feet automatically sank into the fluffy carpet. At this moment, what seemed like a day full of golden rays of sunshine soon became a dark world for me. This would easily become one of the worst days of my life.
After getting up, my first instinct was to look at my phone and realized that it was 7:00 am, time to get up for school. Now in putting my phone aside, I began limping to my bedroom door and began walking down the hallway of my house. Upon walking down this hallway, my vision became tunneled as the only thing I was focused on was my parents‚Äô bedroom door. Once I arrived, I popped their door slowly and a creaking noise began to grow louder as I was opening the door. In stepping inside the room, I began limping my way across the right side of the king bed where my mom was lying asleep. I began to tap her shoulder until she woke up. In agonizing pain, I told her, ‚ÄúMom is it fine if I stay home today? My stomach hurts and I don‚Äôt feel like going to school today.‚Äù With her eyes barely opened, she replied, ‚ÄúSi hijo, it‚Äôs fine if you stay. Do you want something like Pepto Bismol?‚Äù With a sharp pain in my lower right abdominal, I quietly whispered, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù With the conversation dying down with my mom, I quietly left her room and crawled back into bed with the same feeling I woke up with. Not having any experience with serious health problem ever in my life, I was na√Øve believing my pain was only a bad stomachache. However, I was now curled up in a fetal position trying to find an angle that would reprieve me from this agonizing sharp pain.<br><br>

       So, after a good two hours or so nothing helped and that is when my mom bolted into my bedroom. With a worried facial expression, my mom asked, ‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚ÄùBarely able to talk, I quietly replied, ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù Knowing that my mother cared for me deeply, I did not want her to worry during her shift at work which began at 1 p.m. and ended at 9 a.m. 
Thus, knowing I was going to be home alone since both my parents were going to work, I did not want to add more stress upon them. The long hours that followed, drained the life out of me as I was thinking to myself, Is this really how I die? Did I live my life to the fullest? After questioning myself, I came in and out of my sleep hoping and praying that this torture would go away. Sadly, this sharp pain never went away and as I stared outside from my bed, all I could see was the sun slowly come down. Soon it was completely dark outside, and I know my parents would be coming home anytime now. Once my parents arrived, they decided to check up on me and all I gave was a thumbs up signal and that was enough for them to believe that I was okay.
As the night went on for what felt like an eternity, the sun began to glare through my windows. At this point, I could not help but cave in and tell my parents that it was time we go to the emergency room. The severity of the situation hit me like a ton of bricks on the trip to the hospital. I can recall every red light feeling like ten minutes long, every bump on the road making the sharp pains even worse, and every stop light feeling like I was waiting in a line at Disneyland. Now arriving at the hospital, I received a piece of paper in which I had to write down what was hurting and where. After turning in the paper to the nurse up front, I slowly made my way to the waiting room with my parents. After 10 minutes of sitting down, my eyes quickly began to tear up as I could no longer handle this unbearable pain I had. I couldn‚Äôt help but think that my pain was even hurting my mom. Finally, I was called up and at this point only my mom walked in with me as my dad had to go to work.
The doctor then proceeded to take me to a room and asked me a number of questions regarding what the problem was. Having answered all his questions to the best of my knowledge, he said a CT scan would be performed in order to see what was going on with my internally. Once the scans were done, the doctor informed my mom and I that I was positive for appendicitis and that my appendix had indeed ruptured. At this very moment, my heart sank into a bottomless pit as I saw my mom holding back her tears.
<br><br>

        The minutes that followed consisted of me getting ready for surgery which led me to question my religious faith and how my life could end so abruptly. From here on out, I knew all possibilities were out of my hands and were in the hands of my God and the surgeons. With my mom seeing me one last time before surgery, she had prayed over my body and hoped that everything would go well. With the air-purifying respirator on my face, I muffled to my mom saying, ‚ÄúI love you so much.‚Äù Hearing sobs from my mom, she said, ‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù Those final words sunk into my mind as the world was fading out because of the anesthesia. In a matter of what felt like seconds my world was fading back in and I didn‚Äôt know whether I‚Äôd already died or if the recovery room was just bright white. Seconds passed by and I had awakened from the anesthesia and soon I came to realize that the surgery went well.
After experiencing a near death experience, I realized that I have so many things to be grateful for. The feeling of dying at any moment can be frightening, but in order to live life to the fullest, I had to experience this moment. Now, I don‚Äôt claim death being something everyone has to go through in order to appreciate life more, but after experiencing this moment, my life has changed for the better as I now try my hardest to spend time with my loved ones since at any moment death can appear at the door. Now taking this into consideration I continue moving forward with my life and I am thankful for every day I am alive and well.This opporunity has been something for me to acknowledge and be thankful that I am here today. Because of this experience, my passion for the medical field has grown and I will continue to put all my efforts into getting into medical school. As told before in the intro, I will be taking a gap year to build up my resume and accomplish things that I have not done yet. I plan to do community service and provide for my community and impact it a positive way.
